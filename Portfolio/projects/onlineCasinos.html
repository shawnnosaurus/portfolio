    <h2>My Contribution</h2>
    <p>
      Although there was already a system started before I came into the role,
      not a single line of code has not been scrutinised and rewritten by me at
      some stage. Some architectural decisions were already established at this
      point and I had enough experience to hit the ground running, pushing
      through changes within my first week of starting. While reworking, I also
      got everything upgraded to the latest tech stack, starting with old
      Umbraco & dotnet.framework then Next.js & javascript to typescript.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote the entire backend API and
      <a
        href="http://lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html"
        target="_blank"
        >Lucene queries</a
      >
      for the
      <a href="https://umbraco.com/" target="_blank">Umbraco CRM system</a>, in
      order to mimic a headless CMS. Along with the entire
      <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js web app</a>
      integration of multiple casino websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Product Description</h2>
    <p>
      The point of the Online Casinos Management Product, was to enable a
      central cloud centric solution that non-tech individuals could easily spin
      up new casinos while being completely law compliant for the served region
      of each player.
    </p>

    <h3>Headless CMS</h3>
    <p>
      The lobby system comprises a core Headless CMS (Content Management
      System), built on top of the open-source Umbraco dotnet project. This
      hands control of the content over to non-technical business reps and
      market compliance officers. This is optimised to use the free versions of
      all dependencies, with custom indexed queries, to mitigate cost and
      prioritise speed. Along with a linked cloud blob storage for a shared
      image store, through the Umbraco image optimisation layer. Everything is
      laid out in a treeview-like structure, linking specific regions to a
      market and component settings to dynamic pages.
    </p>

    <h3>Full Stack Web App</h3>
    <p>
      While the frontend side uses Next.js with an ISR (Incremental Static
      Regeneration) approach, to prioritise SEO bot crawling, while allowing for
      granular control over the entire web app via the headless CMS integration
      and boost app performance. Amongst this layer, there are a few player
      tracking integrations, along with GEO localisations for market regulations
      or regional laws that all casinos must be adhered to. While also
      integrating with third-party systems via specialised message broker
      channels.
    </p>

    <h3>Hosting & Scaling</h3>
    <p>
      The environments, databases, storage, function apps and facades are all
      hosted on Azure cloud services, as the company is primarily a Microsoft
      house, where the DMZ and URL rewrites are extrapolated via CloudFlare.
