  <h2>My Contribution</h2>
  <p>
    I was picked as part of a task team, to develop a solution
    within 6 weeks, that could wrap any game and turn it into a
    jackpots game. From there I became the lone product owner I
    managed everything, from sourcing business requirements, through
    the entire product life cycle.
  </p>

  <h2>Product</h2>
  <p>
    This solution was created to wrap any game and run jackpots on
    top of it, without the games having to be adapted. This was
    mostly to drive traffick outside of peak gameplay times and push
    other game genres into the jackpot exclusive arena.
  </p>

  <p>
    To achieve this, I took native web components, using the <a href="https://micro-frontends.org/">micro-frontends
      architecture</a>. I created a simple dotnet MVC application, which served this within, in order to easily hijack
    the routing and inject resources from the backend. The client components wrapped the game in an iframe, with
    associated translations and currency formatting. Dependant upon the configuration and launch parameters, my server
    code also injected a custom template file. These templates were able to be interpreted by the components, which then
    got the jackpots via requests to a centralised API maintained by another team and rendered that as the expected
    template theme. All of which is run through a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">finite-state machine</a>, to ensure strict adherence to
    the defined requirement rules.
  </p>

  <h3>Templates</h3>
  <p>
    I created a web component driven templating system, that hooks
    into custom events, in order to customise the vistual aspect of
    the jackpots.
  </p>

  <h3>Image Compression Service</h3>
  <p>
    In order to keep load times to a minimal, I developed a service
    for creating compressed clones of the original images of a given
    directory. These clones are the best quality, for each of the
    supported device resolutions.
  </p>

  <h3>Test Harness</h3>
  <p>
    In order for designers to customise their unique template. I
    developed a test harness, that runs the jackpots client outside
    of the context of the main system. This was eventually used as
    the visualisation of the config system, to easily edit the
    templates from an external application.
  </p>

  <h3>Automation</h3>
  <p>
    In order to have complete trust in the system and templates, I
    created an automation solution, for end to end testing
    regression.
