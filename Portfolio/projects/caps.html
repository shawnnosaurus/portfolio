    <h2>My Contribution</h2>
    <p>
      I was brought in on an consulting capacity, where I was made
      lead of a 4 person team. My privary focus was to engage with the
      client, maintain technical trust, while upgrading the outdated
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time there, I patched SQL injection holes, added true
      Authentication & Authorisation backend and upgraded & refactored
      from WebForms to .NET MVC.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came up with the concept of pushing for paperless
      documentation, to save the business money. Along with
      programming custom VBScript templates, for the client to create
      their entire workflow directly within MS Word and Excel
      respectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Product Description</h2>
    <p>
      The CAPS system was created to take the entire credit approval,
      requisition, mandates, application, documentation and audits
      process to a semi-automated level.
    </p>
    <p>
      These deals are managed by the legal, audit and credit
      departments respectively. Deals are then handled through the
      system by its corresponding processing stages and applicant
      types. Each deal, dependent upon types, owners, and pricings,
      creates their own dynamic reporting and documentation. Sticking
      to a base of logarithmic sub-systems that generate specialised
      and detailed accounting analysis data.
    </p>

    <h3>CMS Sub-System</h3>
    <p>
      The CAPS system was built around a custom made CMS, that
      configured editable pages and user roles, that could customise
      specific clients, product and their credit order.
    </p>

    <h3>Documentation Sub-System</h3>
    <p>
      Majority of the CAPS outputs, feed a document rendering engine,
      with mild versioning and management reports. This was initially
      done in raw HTML, until I partitioned this into .NET MVC views
      and partials.
